[![Python 3.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Is requiered a configuration file (in .yaml format) located in the root direcory of the project, and named ibm_cloud_config in order to have access to those services.
ibm_cloud_config follows the following format:

```
ibm_cf:
    endpoint    : CF_API_ENDPOINT
    namespace   : CF_HOST
    api_key     : CF_API_KEY

ibm_cos:
    endpoint   : COS_API_ENDPOINT
    access_key : ACCESS_KEY
    secret_key : SECRET_KEY
    bucket     : Bucket

rabbitmq:
    url         : URL
```

yaml is necessary to read the configuration file, and it can be intalled like this:

```
sudo pip install pyyaml
```

```
sudo pip3 install pywren-ibm-cloud
```

## Running the program

The program can be executed with the following command:
